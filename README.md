This is **not** a reddit clone I made for fun 😀.

## Setup
Make sure you have the following software installed.

- Node `1.16+`

- MongoDB `4.4+`

Now run `pnpm install`.

After everything has been install run `pnpm prisma generate` this will generate the necessary files for Prisma ORM to work correctly.

Finally you can launch the dev server with `pnpm dev`.

Made with ❤️
